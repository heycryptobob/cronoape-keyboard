<b>Bridging from other chains</b>

Here are 4 ways you can bridge your funds from other chains (BSC, ETH, ...) to Cronos.

Multichain.org (https://app.multichain.org/#/router) (Decentralized Bridge)
ðŸ”¹ Always check the price impact on the assets youâ€™re going to bridge
ðŸ”¹ You canâ€™t bridge CRO, so you wonâ€™t have gas to use the chain

Evodefi.com (https://bridge.evodefi.com/) (Decentralized Bridge)
ðŸ”¹ Always check the price impact on the assets youâ€™re going to bridge
ðŸ”¹ You get 2 CRO (for gas fees)

Elk.finance (https://app.elk.finance/#/elknet) (DEX)
ðŸ”¹ You can only bridge $ELK from chain to chain
ðŸ”¹ Check the tick to receive gas on Cronos chain

Crypto.com (https://crypto.com/) app (CEX)
ðŸ”¹ Deposit your assets on the CDC app
ðŸ”¹ Swap into CRO (So that youâ€™ll have some gas to use the chain)
ðŸ”¹ Withdraw CRO to Cronos Chain (CRC-20)

Once you have bridged. Head over to mm.finance to purchase $CronoApe.
