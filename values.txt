<b>Community Values</b>

1. Believe. 💪
Without belief, nothing ever gets done. So if you ape, ape in with belief.

2. HODL mentality. ✊
Taking profits is important, but don't hurt the chart. Get those $CRO rewards instead.

3. Active Community. 🥳
Speak about $CronoApe to your communities. Bring them in. Join our raids, help new members.

4. Be Innovative. 🚀
Ask for forgiveness, not permission. If you have a crazy idea to help. Go for it!

Only ape what you can afford to lose.
